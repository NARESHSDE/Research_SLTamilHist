Sri Lanka has a long Tamil cultural history that is vastly distinct from the culture of Sri Lankan Tamils. All historical and cultural artifacts are of worldwide significance. Heritage properties are constantly threatened by a variety of natural and man-made factors, many of which are unanticipated. It is understandable that there is no digital platform in the Sri Lankan Tamil context for documenting historical data with geographical pointing. As a result, there is a need to create a consolidated archive or a digital platform for the Tamil cultural background through this research. Based on an earlier study, it was determined that this was the first outstanding attempt in the Sri Lankan Tamil setting. With the recent development of information and communication technology, we have opened the possibility of approaching these cultural studies from a digital humanities perspective. This web application has been developed to provide a proper solution to the aforementioned issue. To build the research solution, a GeoNode architecture-based solution and an appropriate mapping technique are provided. A GIS platform and a format-agnostic data repository will serve as the foundation for the proposed system. This can be used to tag data items with location identifiers as well as any other relevant metadata like temporal identifiers. This platform is exposed to volunteers, visitors, researchers, and admins. Machine Learning and Deep Learning were utilized to improve the user experience as well as to recommend data and automate data pattern identification.

              <h2 class="mid"> <b>Methodology</b></h2>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">In this research, A GeoNode architecture-based approach and a suitable mapping technique are proposed to develop the research solution. The proposed framework will be underpinned by a GIS platform and a format-agnostic data repository. This can be used to tag data items with location identifiers and any other relevant metadata such as temporal identifies. The location identifier is a component that can be used to identify the place where the data was collected. It can also be used to identify specific places related to the history of the collected data. The web-based application will provide an easy-to-use interface for non-technical users to effectively search through vast amounts of data by utilizing natural language processing. We will use Machine Learning and Deep Learning to provide a better user experience to users and to check the level of data accuracy and automatic data pattern recognition. We also provide filtration mechanisms in the platform to find the exact data points and capabilities for pointing and drawing features on top of GIS maps for necessary research works.

                  <p style="text-align: justify;">For product development, we will use the Geo Node architecture. The GeoNode web application is the framework's fundamental component, and it orchestrates client interaction with the system's other components. It's written in Django, a Python web framework, and it uses a relational database, most commonly PostgreSQL or SQLite, but it can use any RDBMS that Django supports. as well as we are going to use third-party ML services for AI applied areas in the product. The below table shows all the details of the technologies which we are going to use in every phase.</p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">Based on our research, there are several stages that we have to complete throughout our project. They are namely data collection, data transformation, model training, and testing, server implementation, and evaluation. Here we are going to train our model using azure machine learning with dummy data of Tamil culture. Then the algorithm will classify whether these cultural data are reliable or not.</p>

              <!-- <p>Sri Lanka has a long Tamil cultural history that is very much diverged from the Tamil culture of Sri Lanka. This can be seen in many aspects of the cultural representation of the Sri Lankan Tamil society. From creative art forms to traditional religious practices, there are many observable differences between these groups. In this context, it should be noted that any research into Tamil culture and cultural history has to take into account the geographical context of any such cultural expressions.</p>
              <p>The recent advancements in technology, especially in information and communication technology, have created an opportunity to approach these cultural researches through a digital humanities lens. This includes the possibilities of connected datasets and exploring and correlating otherwise disjointed research outcomes. One such application of this approach is termed spatial humanities, where location-based information from a Geographical Information System (GIS) is combined with other forms of culturally significant data to produce a much richer representation of knowledge that can both temporally and geographically better presented and interpreted. There have been several efforts in this respect globally and a few in India, but so far this has not been applied in the context of Sri Lanka, and especially Sri Lankan Tamil culture.

Entering this Research in the direction of Tamil Culture heritage digitization, I believe it has a lot of room for development and an ideal industry to make a career out of. As well as the experience I gained through this research and project helped me to get a better understanding of building commercial products from scratch.</p>              </div>

                <p>I am passionate about software quality engineering. As a software tester, I am involved in visionary actions. Visualize the potential pitfalls of a product or software program. Review quality specifications and technical design documents to provide timely and meaningful feedback on the software product. Always make an effort to ensure a product's quality and whether or not the final consumer is satisfied. Through this research, I was able to ensure the quality of the product and was able to give a better user experience using this product.</p>
